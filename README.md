# Convolutional Code Generator

## Overview

This project describes the implementation of a Convolutional Code Generator using VHDL, synthesized with the Vivado tool. Two different architectures are presented, highlighting the performance variations between them.

## Features

- **Convolutional Code Generation**: Implements convolutional encoding for error correction.
- **Multiple Architectures**: Two architectures are provided to compare performance differences.
- **VHDL Implementation**: Code is written in VHDL for FPGA synthesis.
- **Vivado Synthesis**: Synthesized and tested using Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.

## Hardware Requirements

- **FPGA Board**: Compatible with the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.
- **Development Environment**: Computer capable of running Vivado.

## Software Requirements

- **Vivado Design Suite**: Xilinx's design tool for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the [Vivado Design Suite](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) from Xilinx.


# Simulation Instructions
In the /vhdl folder, run simulatore.exe. The files InputVhd.txt and OutputVhd.txt will be automatically cleared.
Enter 16 bits. These will be written to InputVhd.txt.
Start the TestBench and begin the simulation.
The output of the VHDL generator will be present in OutputVhd.txt.
In the terminal, press S to verify that OutputVhd.txt matches the output generated by the C simulator.
Press any key to end the simulation.
